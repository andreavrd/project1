        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>challenges</code> I encountered were many. I wanted to my TV Show
          bio to appear when hovering, but was not able to figure it out. I was also
          unable to make the bios completely responsive.
        </p>

      <div class="unit half">
        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the <code>facts or things</code> I learned was that I had to use a grid
          online to be able to figure it out and that responsive web design has to be
          practiced to be learned. I definitely saw the difference between doing it myself and doing it in class.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit half">
        <h2>Techniques learned</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the <code>techniques</code> I learned were - as I said- using gribs that
          have already been designed and using the gribs to make our own design. I also learned
          some more about transformation and transitions through CSS Tricks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit half">
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
        I used CSS Tricks, W3Schools, Gridism, Skeleton and Initializr. As well as
        the videos for transitions and the Shay Howe's example, and many other class resources.

        <h2>What would I improve</h2>
        <p>
          I think I can <code>improve </code> the transitions by adding the bios
          when hovering only, also I would like to improve how my navigation bar looks,
          I would like to make a line that separates it from the rest of the body but not
          as long as the entire site, just under the menu. I like my website and what I
          did with it, I like the clean lay out. However, I know I am repepetitive with
          my design, I do not know if that is bad, but I could probably play more with different styles.
          Lastly, I think I could have made a better Home page, I really do not what is missing,
          maybe some picture, but it seems really basic to me.
